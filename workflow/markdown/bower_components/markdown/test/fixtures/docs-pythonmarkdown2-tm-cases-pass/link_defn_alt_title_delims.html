<p>Alternative delimiters for <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link" title="link syntax">link definitions</a> are allowed -- as of
Markdown 1.0.2, I think. Hence, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link" title="link syntax">this link</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link" title="link syntax">this link</a> work
too.</p>
